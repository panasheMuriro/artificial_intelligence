# What is TensorFlow?
TensorFlow is an open-source deep-learning framework developed by Google. It’s widely used for machine learning tasks, such as:

- Data processing
- Training models
- Deploying models

TensorFlow is popular because it’s efficient, has strong community support, and can run on both CPUs and GPUs, making it scalable for small or large projects.

## Understanding Tensors
Tensors are the core data structure in TensorFlow. Think of them as multi-dimensional arrays, similar to Python lists or NumPy arrays, but optimized for large-scale computations.

- Scalar (0-D Tensor): A single number, like 4.0
- Vector (1-D Tensor): An array of numbers, like [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
- Matrix (2-D Tensor): A 2D array, like [[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]
- Higher-dimensional Tensors: For complex datasets, like images or videos
